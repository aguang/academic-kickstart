August Guang, Genomics Data Scientist @ [Brown University's Computational Biology Core](https://www.brown.edu/research/projects/computational-biology-of-human-disease/), member @ [Tooth&Nail Collective](https://www.facebook.com/toothnail/) and member @ [Free Radicals](https://freerads.org/) East Coast.

I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics and Computational Biology from Brown University in 2017. My primary research interest is in quantifying uncertainty in genomics data; my dissertation was on uncertainty in phylogenetic workflows with an application to HIV transmission inference. In a way, that is also my motivation and mantra in community organizing: becoming comfortable with uncertainty and always pushing for change.
